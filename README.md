# OA Leadership Proflies

A plugin which adds the post types, fields, and shortcodes to manage and display leadership positions on a WordPress site.
In use on [Tahosa Lodge](http://tahosalodge.org) and [Section W2S](http://sectionw2s.org)

## Description
I originally wrote this functionality for Tahosa Lodge, and recently duplicated it on Section W2S' website. 
I made a significant number of improvements when adding it to the section site, and decided that I'd make it into a plugin so I didn't have to keep 2 copies of the same code up to date. I also feel like other scouting groups might like it.
The plugin is very much a work in progress, as to start with, I need it to work on these two sites. I'm working on abstracting things out, so that there's nothing hardcoded.

## Requirements

* WordPress 4.1 (not worried about backward compatability - for now)
* Advanced Custom Fields 5.x

## Updates
This plugin is hosted on GitHub, and can be updated using the [GitHub Updater Plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/)

## Version History

* 0.1 Initial version - rough but working
* 0.2 Add ACF JSON & related features
* 0.3 Add taxonomies to People
* 0.4 Add search on Position page when selecting a Person, overall styles, fix sort order
